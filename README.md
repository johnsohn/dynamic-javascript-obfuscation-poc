## Dynamic Javascript Obfuscation / Malware Obfuscated at the Point Of Delivery POC

This project is a POC (proof of concept) of malware being obfuscated at the point of delivery. Once the victim visits the payload dropper, the script obfuscates code before the point of delivery also allowing the attacker to change what file he/she downloads & executes post-exploitation.
It is an antivirus evasion tool that can be integrated into campaigns in order to break signatures and ensure higher infection rates.
## Why?

I wanted to see how antivirus companies would react to the outcome and I have to say I'm not surprised.

## Installation

Host the script somewhere and edit the URL & process name that you want it to be ran as.

## Results

Out of 58 antiviruses ONLY 7 of them caught the samples generated by the script. Most of the detections were heuristic.
MalwareBytes detects it as an "exploit" if ran from the Chrome browser, however it doesn't if it is ran outside a browser.
